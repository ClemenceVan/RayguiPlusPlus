# RayGUI++: Lightweight Immediate Mode GUI Library for Raylib

RayGUI++ is a lightweight, immediate mode graphical user interface (GUI) library designed specifically for use with the Raylib game development framework in C++. The project is heavily based on the RayGUI library but aims to provide immediate mode GUI capabilities for C++ projects.

## Project Vision:

RayGUI++ aims to offer a simple and efficient solution for creating user interfaces in C++ projects using the Raylib framework. It follows the immediate mode GUI paradigm, allowing GUI elements to be drawn and updated directly within the application's rendering loop.

## Planned Features:

- Integration with Raylib: Seamless integration with the Raylib game development framework, leveraging its graphics capabilities.
  
- Lightweight Design: Minimalistic design with essential GUI components, suitable for real-time applications like games.
  
- Customization Options: Support for customization, allowing developers to adjust colors, sizes, and other parameters to fit their project's requirements.

## Current Status:

At present, RayGUI++ is in its early stages, with basic functionality being developed. Contributors are welcome to join the project and help shape its future direction.
