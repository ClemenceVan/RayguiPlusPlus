# RayGUI++: Lightweight Retained Mode GUI Library for Raylib

RayGUI++ is a lightweight, retained mode graphical user interface (GUI) library designed specifically for use with the Raylib game development framework in C++. The project is heavily based on the RayGUI library but aims to provide retained mode GUI capabilities for C++ projects.

## Project Vision:

RayGUI++ aims to offer a simple and efficient solution for creating user interfaces in C++ projects using the Raylib framework. It follows the retained mode GUI paradigm, allowing GUI elements to be created and maintained separately from the rendering loop. In this approach, UI elements persist and are managed throughout the application's lifetime. Updates to UI elements occur independently of rendering, allowing for a clear separation between UI state management and rendering processes.

## Planned Features:

- Integration with Raylib: Seamless integration with the Raylib game development framework, leveraging its graphics capabilities.
  
- Lightweight Design: Minimalistic design with essential GUI components, suitable for real-time applications like games.
  
- Customization Options: Support for customization, allowing developers to adjust colors, sizes, and other parameters to fit their project's requirements.

## Current Status:

At present, RayGUI++ is in its early stages, with basic functionality being developed. Contributors are welcome to join the project and help shape its future direction.
